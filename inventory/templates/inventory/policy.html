        <h2>Accessing user data</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            FLPInventory is using the 
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/api">
                Google Drive API
            </a> 
            to make it easier to store files on Google Drive.
            FosterLove is a single client based website for a non-profit organization in Pittsburgh, 
            Pennsylvania that focuses on providing clothing, and other support systems to foster kids across the 
            Pittsburgh region. Our use of Google APIs with FLPInventory is subject to each APIâ€™s respective 
            terms of service. See 
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/">
                Google APIs Terms of Service
            </a>
            for more information.
        </p>
        <h2>Accessing user data</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            FLPInventory accesses Google resources from the device where you use FLPInventory. 
            Your machine communicates directly with the Google APIs. However, no data from your local machine 
            is utilized when uploading to your Google Drive. The FLPInventory application never receives your 
            data or the permission to access your data. The owners of the project can only see anonymous, 
            aggregated information about usage of tokens obtained through its OAuth client, such as which
            APIs and endpoints are being used. The website does not collect, or locally store any data on any
            unauthorized machine. FLPInventory sends users to 
            <a href="https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth">
                Google's Authorization Endpoint
            </a>
            for authorization and does not directly access or collect user data. 
        </p>

        <h2>Using user data</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            FLPInventory includes functions that you can execute in order to upload server-stored data - 
            FLPInventory does not upload any data from your local machine. This can only happen after FLPInventory
            collects an authorization token, which is collected after you authenticate yourself as a specific
            Google user and authorize FLPInventory. The OAuth consent screen will describe the scope of what
            is being authorized. For FLPInventory, this authorization will only allow FLPInventory to
            view and manage Google Drive files and folders that you have opened or created with this app.
            There is no instance where the FLPInventory will automatically manipulate data or have an automated
            workflow. The user has full control of the data and the OAuth consent screen shows which user is 
            logged into the account. 
        </p>
        <h2>Scopes</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            FLPInventory utilizes 
            <code style="background: rgb(255, 255, 255) !important;">
                https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file 
            </code>
            Scope from the Google Drive API v3 Scopes. 
            This allows FLPInventory to view and manage Google Drive files and 
            folders that you have opened or created with this app. See 
            <a href=https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes">
                Google's Scopes for OAuth 2.0
            </a> 
            for more information.
        </p>
        <h2>Sharing User Data</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            FLPInventory only communicates with Google APIs. No user data is shared with the owners of the 
            FLPInventory or any other party.
        </p>
        <h2>Storing User Data</h2> 
        <hr>
        <p>
            FLPInventory only stores access tokens and refresh tokens from Google Drive API until they expire.
            They are then deleted or replaced shortly thereafter. See
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2"> 
                Using OAuth 2.0 to Access Google APIs
            </a>
            for more information on access and refresh tokens using Google APIs with OAuth 2.0.
        </p>
        <h2>Usage in other packages or Applications</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Do not use an API Key or Client ID from the FLPInventory application in an external package or tool.
            See
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">
                Google API Services User Data Policy
